How Branches in GitHub and Git Work
GitHub (and Git) enables you to control which version of the code gets deployed to your production.

And branches play a fundamental role in this.

Every time you deploy code to production, you’ll obviously want to make sure you’re only deploying the most stable version.

But how do you make sure you always have a stable version ready for deploy when you’ve got multiple teammates constantly working on new features and bug fixes?

By creating multiple branches.
